Added functions and variables of screenshot wherever icons were there. Basically copied and edited the functions and variables of icon. Search for icon keyworh in the class and below it find variables and function for screenshot.

DB.java ( in some places screenshots are commented. they are not required there.)
// AppListAdapter.java
// UpdateService.java
AppDetails.java
FDroidApp.java
RepoXMLHandler.java

there's some problem with the layout due to which image is not being set. check for that.
also added image view for screenshot in appdetails.xml in layout and layout-land



to change:

1. change the category view from top to left side list view.
2. add star rating to the appdetail.xml and program it.
3. the Ping.java is not working. program it accordingly
